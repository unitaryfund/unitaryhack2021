## [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement errors, etc. Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in clever ways.

## [Interlin-q](https://github.com/Interlin-q/Interlin-q)

Interlin-q is a simulation platform for simulating distributed quantum algorithms. The purpose
of Interlin-q is to be able to enter a monolithic quantum circuit and based on the distributed
architecture, automatically map the circuit and then simulate the control process to run the algorithm.

## [QRAND](https://github.com/pedrorrivero/qrand)

QRAND is a smart quantum random number generator for arbitrary probability 
distributions, which operates by providing a multiplatform NumPy adapter 
interface (e.g. qiskit, cirq, qsharp). To boost the randomness production 
speed it implements an efficient randomness retrieval strategy based on caching 
and multithreading.

On top of that, it also allows the design and use of different platform-agnostic 
quantum randomness generation protocols; as well as performing validation on the 
results, according to a variety of NIST standards.

## [qqcs](https://github.com/dde/qqcs)

QQCS is a simple linear notation for the simulation of quantum circuits.

It is an educational tool that can be easily used by students new to Quantum Computing.

It provides automatic mathematical analysis of circuits by incorporating the matrix mathematics necessary to provide insight to circuit operation, and by displaying the details at each execution step, something not available from quantum computer simulated execution.

It can be executed in interactive or batch mode.

For example, here is the QQCS statement for the classic superdense coding circuit of Eve, Alice, and Bob.

```|00>:H_:C01:X_:Z_:C01:H_:MM```
