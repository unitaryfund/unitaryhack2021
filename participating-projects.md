## [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement errors, etc.
Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in clever ways.
You can watch some videos about Mitiq on the [Unitary Fund YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KDQtWzJcfw&list=PL-VMs2BCTI_lklMMfY4iMdETT19rgZe5o).

## [Q#](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language/tree/main/Specifications/Language)

We are working on adding support for compiling Q# to [QIR](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/tree/main/src/QsCompiler/QirGeneration) and executing it. QIR is a convention for how to represent quantum programs in [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/). We aim to ultimately move the Q# compiler to be fully LLVM-based.

While the support and integration is not yet complete, we have set up an example for how to compile a Q# project to QIR and execute it on our full state simulator for early adventurers who are excited to give it a try!

For Unitary Hack, we have defined two tasks in particular to explore QIR:
      
### Bounties

#### $25 each
- Create an imaginative Q# program that is significantly different than any of our [samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum), compile it to QIR, and execute it on our full state simulator. Create a PR adding the program to the [example](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/blob/unitaryhack/examples/QIR/Development/Program.qs) and post or attach the generated QIR to one of these GitHub issues: [example 1](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1028), [example 2](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1031), [example 3](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/1032).


#### $50 each
- Find a Q# program that doesn't compile correctly into QIR or unexpectedly fails when executing the QIR on the full state simulator due to an issue with the generated QIR that hasn't been [filed](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22area%3A+QIR%22) yet, and [file the issue](https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-compiler/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+area%3A+QIR&template=unitary_hack.md&title=[UnitaryHack]).
