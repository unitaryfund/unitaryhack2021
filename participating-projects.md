## [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement errors, etc. Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in clever ways.

## [Interlin-q](https://github.com/Interlin-q/Interlin-q)

Interlin-q is a simulation platform for simulating distributed quantum algorithms. The purpose
of Interlin-q is to be able to enter a monolithic quantum circuit and based on the distributed
architecture, automatically map the circuit and then simulate the control process to run the algorithm.

## [QRAND](https://github.com/pedrorrivero/qrand)

QRAND is a smart quantum random number generator for arbitrary probability 
distributions, which operates by providing a multiplatform NumPy adapter 
interface (e.g. qiskit, cirq, qsharp). To boost the randomness production 
speed it implements an efficient randomness retrieval strategy based on caching 
and multithreading.

On top of that, it also allows the design and use of different platform-agnostic 
quantum randomness generation protocols; as well as performing validation on the 
results, according to a variety of NIST standards.
